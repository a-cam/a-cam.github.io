							I decided to create this after wondering whether a group of particles who all mutally repel each other would eventually arrange

						I created this C# form app as just a quick test of this idea. It consists of a cirlce and 100 particles initially inside the circle
						All the particles experience a repulsive force from the other particles and from the circle walls in accordance with an inverse square
						law. The result can be seen in this video.

						As you can quite clearly see in the video the particles don't arrange themselves into a nice neat pattern as I had first thought.
						Though this had me wondering about what happens at longer time scales than the 2 minute clip. Since fast moving particles leave the circle
						overcoming its repulsion, does the number of particles in the circle at least tend to a value where some sort of equilibrium is reached?
					</p>
					<p>
						Running the simulation over many iterations I ended up with the following graph for number of particles remaining against time.

						As you can see the number of particles does indeed tend to a minimum value over time. But then what about the average speed of the particles?
						It makes sense to be fast at the start when there is a lot of chaotic motion but then does it too tend to a minimum speed over time?
					</p>
					<p>
						Running the simulation over many cycles again, I get the following result for the average speed of the particles over time.
					</p>

						<div class="fh5co-grid-graphs animate-box" style="background-image: url(images/particle_simulator/speed_over_time.PNG);">
						</div>
					</center>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
				<div class="row">
					<p>
						Again the speed does seem to stabalise over time, however the drop is not as significant as the drop in the population of particles.
						It also seems to converge on the minimum value quite quickly providing further proof that the system won't ever converge on the stable
						pattern I had first imagined.
					</p>
					<p>
						Though thinking about it now, it does make sense since a system where the particles are all mutually repelling and keeping each other
						stationary is going to be very unstable so it could never get into that state in the first place. The drop in speed could be thought about
						in terms of energy since the particles start off with potential energy from being in the repulsive fields which is then converted into kinetic
						energy. As the fast particles leave the overall energy of the system decreases accounting for that drop in speed. As the particle number levels
						off so does the average speed. In fact the particle number can be said to decrease from approximately 100 to around 25, a factor of 1/4. The
						speed drops from around 2 to 1, a factor of 1/2. Since kinetic energy is proportional to veloctiy squared this makes sense since a drop in speed
						of 1/2 will mean 1/4 less energy and if we assume each particle contributes the same energy to the total energy of the system this accounts for the
						1/4 drop in particle number.
					</p>
					<p>
						One final thing I wondered about was whether the distribution of particles within the cirlce is even or do particles tend to spend more time
						in some sections of the circle? To test this out I had the app create an image of all the particle paths meaning darker areas would represent
						areas where particles spent more time. I ended up with the following two images, one over a longer period of time.
